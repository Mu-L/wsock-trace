 *
 * \brief
 *  Functions for listening for "Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)" events
 *
 *  The `fw_init()` and `fw_monitor_start()` needs Administrator privileges. <br>
 *  Running `firewall_test.exe` as a normal non-elevated user will normally cause an
 *  "Access denied"                             (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED = 5`) or <br>
 *  "The device does not recognize the command" (`ERROR_BAD_COMMAND = 22`).
 *
 * Thanks to Steven G (a.k.a. dmex) for his implementation of similar stuff in his ProcessHacker:
 *   \li https://github.com/processhacker/plugins-extra/blob/master/FirewallMonitorPlugin/fw.c
 *   \li https://github.com/processhacker/plugins-extra/blob/master/FirewallMonitorPlugin/monitor.c
 *
 * Also many thanks to Henry++ for his SimpleWall:
 *   \li https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall/blob/master/src/main.cpp
 *
 * A rather messy but rich example is at:
 *   \li https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/74e3bf1d-3a0b-43ce-a528-2a88bc1fb882/log-packets?forum=wfp
 *
 * Another "Windows Firewall Control" program at:
 *   \li https://www.binisoft.org/wfc.php
 *
 * From the command-line, the `netsh` program can be used.
   To show "Global Settings" and "Profile Settings" for WFP:
 * ```
 *   c:\> netsh advfirewall monitor show firewall
 * ```
 *
 * Show the GUID and .DLLs involved in filtering:
 * ```
 *   c:\> netsh show helper | grep -i -e firewall -e wfp
 *        {02BC1F81-D927-4EC5-8CBC-8DD65E3E38E8}  AUTHFWCFG.DLL  advfirewall
 *        {35342B49-83B4-4FCC-A90D-278533D5BEA2}  AUTHFWCFG.DLL  firewall
 *        {8B3A0D7F-1F30-4402-B753-C4B2C7607C97}  FWCFG.DLL      firewall
 *        {3BB6DA1D-AC0C-4972-AC05-B22F49DEA9B6}  NSHWFP.DLL     wfp
 * ```
