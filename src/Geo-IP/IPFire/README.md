## To-do

My initial port of **[LibLoc](https://git.ipfire.org/?p=location/libloc.git;a=tree)**.<br>

* Note: the text-database from https://git.ipfire.org/?p=location/location-database.git;a=tree <br>
        is not here. It can be generated by the command:
  ```
  py -3 location.py dump > database.txt
  ```
  which will generate an approximately 115 Mbyte file!
  But use the binary database from:
   * https://location.ipfire.org/databases/1/location.db.xz  -- the latest most up-to-date version
   * https://location.ipfire.org/databases/1/archive/        -- older versions
