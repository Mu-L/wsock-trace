## Generating documentation

The documentation is generated by **[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/)**
via the `wsock_trace..Doxyfile` config-file.

Running the command `doxygen wsock_trace.Doxyfile`, requires `hhc.exe`.
This is part of the **[Microsoft HTML Workshop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/htmlhelp/microsoft-html-help-downloads)**.
This will generate the compressed HTML-file `wsock_trace.chm` of the generated documentation.

Rebuilding this `.chm`-file file needs a GNU Make v4.x program. Enter this directory
and issue `make` or `mingw32-make` with one if these targets:
```
make all   - should produce wsock_trace.chm in this directory.
make clean - should delete all generated files.
```

`wsock_trace.chm` can be view by the command `start wsock_trace.chm` (which is normally
pointing to `"%WINDIR%\hh.exe"`). <br>
Or load using the excellent **[SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)**
or **[KchmViewer](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/linux/kchmviewer/getting-kchmviewer/)** programs.
